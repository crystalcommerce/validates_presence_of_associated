ValidatesPresenceOfAssociated
=============================

Simple plugin that provides validates_presence_of_associated, which validates presence of association id unless a new association object is present

Solves a circular dependency of requiring the foreign key to be valid, but needing to be valid before saving the foreign object to generate the key

Example
=======

class Foo
  belongs_to :bar
  validates_presence_of_associated :bar
end
